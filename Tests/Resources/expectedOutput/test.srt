1
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,207
This blade has a dark past.

2
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,792
It has shed much innocent blood.

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,457
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

4
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,792
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

5
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,291
Thank you.

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
So...

7
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:13,792
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm searching for someone.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,207
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

10
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,000
A dragon.

11
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

12
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:35,875
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

13
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,500
We're almost done. Shhh...

14
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, sit still.

15
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,250
Good night, Scales.

16
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:13,832
Get him, Scales! Come on!

17
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,250
Scales?

18
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah! Come on!

19
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,000
Scales!

20
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,500
I have failed.

21
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,500
You've only failed to see...

22
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

23
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,000
You are closer than you know.

24
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,500
Scales!

25
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:24,000
Scales?

26
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:29,792
Scales...
